File containing background, texts, collision, effects, music and player position settings for each cities and places.

## Structure

| Offset | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 0x00   | uint32 | [Data Pointer](#data-pointer)

### Data Pointer

| Offset | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 0x00   | uint32 | Dummy Data
| 0x04   | uint32 | [Background LBA](#background-lba)
| 0x08   | uint32 | [Zone Position](#zone-position)
| 0x0C   | uint32 | [Zone Transition](#zone-transition)
| 0x10   | uint32 | [Zone Collision](#zone-collision)
| 0x14   | uint32 | BGM
| 0x18   | uint32 | [Metallic Footsteps](#metallic-footsteps)
| 0x1C   | uint32 | [Zone Effects](#zone-effects)
| 0x20   | uint32 | [Message LBA](#message-lba)

### Background LBA
This is the LBA string value from **_SLUS_011.93_** related to the **CITY/BG/BKxxxxST.BIN** file. That forms the background of the zone, as shown in the image example from **_BK2250ST.BIN_**.

### Zone Position
Defines the character's position when entering the zone.<br>
* _You can place as many zone positions as you like, but remember that if you add a battle event to the zone, the **third zone position** must be added, because it is used automatically after the battle._

| Offset | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 0x00   | uint8 | X-Axis Position (Horizontal Position)
| 0x01   | uint8 | Y-Axis Posotion (Vertical Position)
| 0x02   | uint8 | [Rotation ID](#rotation-id)
| 0x03   | uint8 | Dummy

#### Rotation ID

| ID | Rotation |
|--------|------|
| 0x00   | Down |
| 0x01   | Left |
| 0x02   | Up |
| 0x03   | Right |

### Zone Transition
Defines the positions and zone that will be loaded when entering a door.<br>
_For example, you can go from **Tamer's club** to **Jijimon's House** on the other island._<br>
* _You can put as many zone transitions as you like, but remember to put uint32 nulls bytes after set all zones transition, see example bellow._
```
0A 10 2D 06 0B 0E 2D 06 0C 10 2D 06 00 00 00 00
```

| Offset | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 0x00   | uint8 | X-Axis Position (Horizontal Position)
| 0x01   | uint8 | Y-Axis Posotion (Vertical Position)
| 0x02   | uint8 | [Zone ID](#)
| 0x03   | uint8 | Zone Position Number

### Zone Collision
Position value of the zone collision, which is actually defined through tiles with **_1bpp linear, reverse order_** formats, as shown in the image example below from Meditation Dome - left room linked to **_BK2250ST.BIN_**.

### Metallic Footsteps
Position value of the metallic footsteep collision, this is used to give the metallic sound when the player walks over metallic platforms, which is actually defined through tiles with **_1bpp linear, reverse order_** formats, as shown in the image example below from Meditation Dome - left room linked to **_BK2250ST.BIN_**.

### Zone Effects
Defines which effect will be loaded from MASKWIN0.BIN.<br>
* _For example, the RGB lights used in Tamer's Club on the stage where Palmon is singing._

| Offset | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 0x00   | uint16 | [Effect ID](#)
| 0x02   | uint16 | Identifier (Aways 0F 0D)

### Message LBA
This is the LBA string value from **_SLUS_011.93_** related to the **CITY/MESS/MESSxxxx.BIN** file. It determines which text will be used in the zone.
